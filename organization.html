<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>All work in this course is to be done individually unless otherwise
noted (e.g., the group final project for CS 698).</p>

<p>The penalty for plagiarism (first offense) is an assigned grade of
0 for that particular component <i>and</i> a 10% reduction of the
final grade. Note that this penalty applies to both the individual(s)
giving as well as the individual(s) receiving the assistance. In
addition, a letter detailing the offense will be sent to the Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, meaning that subsequent offenses will
carry more severe penalties, up to suspension or expulsion.</p>

<p>To avoid inadvertently plagiarizing, you should discuss assignment
issues with other students only in a very broad and high-level
fashion. Do not take notes during such discussions and do not looking
at anyone else's code, on screen or on paper. If you find yourself
stuck, contact the TAs or the instructor for help. You are allowed to
search the web for information about <i>general issues</i>, but do not
try to search for solutions online (or ask for help online on mailing
lists or in forums such as StackOverflow, etc.). The assignments are
designed so that solutions are not available online, but if you
inadvertently stumble onto a solution to any of the assignments, do
not look at it. If you do find a solution online, however, please let
us know&mdash;we will appreciate it and not construe it as plagiarism
(unless, of course, you actually do copy the solution).</p>

<p>Senate Undergraduate Council has asked us to post the following
paragraphs:</p>

<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b> In order to maintain a culture of
academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community
are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and
responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Grievance:</b> A student who believes that a decision affecting
some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable
may have grounds for initiating a
grievance. Read <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm">Policy
70 - Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>.

<p><b>Discipline:</b> A student is expected to know what constitutes
academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take
responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an
action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to
avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group
work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor,
academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. When misconduct
has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties will be
imposed
under <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm">Policy
71 - Student Discipline</a>. For information on categories of offenses
and types of penalties, students should refer to that policy.

<p><b>Avoiding Academic Offenses:</b> Most students are unaware of the
line between acceptable and unacceptable academic behaviour,
especially when discussing assignments with classmates and using the
work of other students.  For information on commonly misunderstood
academic offenses and how to avoid them, students should refer to the
<a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/Current/cheating_policy.shtml">Faculty
of Mathematics Cheating and Student Academic Discipline Policy</a>.

<p><b>Appeals:</b> A student may appeal the finding and/or penalty in
a decision made under Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances
(other than regarding a petition) or Policy 71 - Student Discipline if
a ground for an appeal can be
established. Read <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm">Policy
72 - Student Appeals</a>.

<h3>Accommodations</h3>

<p><b>Illness policy:</b> From time to time students become ill or
have ongoing medical conditions that prevent them from meeting
academic obligations. For these cases, please consult
the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/examination-regulations-and-related-matters">university
policy</a>.</p>

<p><b>Accommodations for Religious Holidays and Other Special
Circumstances.</b> Students wishing to discuss accommodations for
religious holidays on dates that assignments are due, or other
circumstances not addressed in this course information page, should
discuss those circumstances with me before the third class session in
order to permit adequate time for planning. Only accommodations for
unforeseeable circumstances will be considered after that date.</p>

<p><b>Note for students with
disabilities:</b> <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services">AccessAbility
Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, collaborates with all academic
departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with
disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the
curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the
impact of your disability, please register with them at the beginning
of each academic term.</p>
